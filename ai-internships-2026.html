  <h1>How AI Is Replacing Internships (And What Students Should Do)</h1>

  <p>
    Internships were once the primary way students gained real-world experience.
    In 2026, AI tools are slowly changing this traditional path. Many tasks once
    assigned to interns are now handled by automation.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Companies Are Using AI Instead of Interns</h2>
  <p>
    AI tools work faster, cost less, and operate without supervision. Companies now
    use AI for data analysis, content drafting, customer support, and research — tasks
    that interns once performed.
  </p>

  <h2>What This Means for Students</h2>
  <p>
    This shift does not mean opportunities are disappearing. Instead, expectations
    are changing. Students are now expected to bring skills, not just certificates.
  </p>

  <h2>Skills That Matter More Than Ever</h2>
  <p>
    Critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and communication are skills AI
    cannot fully replace. Students who develop these alongside technical knowledge
    will remain valuable.
  </p>

  <h2>What Students Should Do Now</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of relying only on internships, students should build portfolios, learn
    practical tools, and work on real projects. Experience matters more than titles.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    AI is reshaping internships, not eliminating student growth. Those who adapt early
    will benefit the most in the coming years.
