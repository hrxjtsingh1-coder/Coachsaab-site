  <h1>Can AI Help You Make Money Under 18? Reality vs Hype</h1>

  <p>
    Social media often claims that AI can make anyone rich overnight.
    For students under 18, the truth is more balanced than the hype.
  </p>

  <h2>The Reality of Earning with AI</h2>
  <p>
    AI does not directly give money. It provides tools that improve productivity,
    creativity, and efficiency. Income still depends on skill, effort, and patience.
  </p>

  <h2>Safe Ways Students Can Use AI</h2>
  <p>
    Students can use AI for content creation, learning digital skills, tutoring support,
    and personal projects. These activities build experience rather than risky shortcuts.
  </p>

  <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
  <p>
    Avoid platforms promising guaranteed income or requiring upfront payments.
    These are often unrealistic or unsafe for minors.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
  <p>
    AI can support learning and small opportunities, but it is not a magic solution.
    Long-term skill development is always more reliable than hype.
