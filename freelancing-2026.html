  </p>

  <h2>The Current Freelancing Landscape</h2>
  <p>
    Competition is higher, but so are opportunities. Clients now value
    problem-solving and reliability over simple task completion.
  </p>

  <h2>How AI Changes Freelancing</h2>

    Freelancing is still worth it for those willing to learn,
    improve communication, and focus on long-term growth.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    Freelancing in 2026 rewards skills, consistency, and trust.
    AI is a tool — not a replacement for human effort.
